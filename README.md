# nfl_big_data_bowl_2022

This repo contains my work for this Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022

I decided to look at fake punts and what makes them successful.

fake_punt_submission.RMD - Contains my entry for the competition. Unfortunately, I started the contest late and there were a few things that I did not have time to include.

fake_punt_notebook.RMD - Contains an expanded exploration that couldn't be included in my contest submission (work currently in progress)
